    <p>&emsp;Hello world. My name is Jashyn harrison and I am a first year scholar here at smash. And I'm here to tell you a little about my self. So to start things off i am a 15 year old male who likes to play video games,edit videos and sometimes/rarely draw. I also like to learn new things that I've never learned before like coding which I'm doing right now. Most of the time i stay at home and play games or watch anime. Anime is really the only thing that i watch besides youtube and netflix. Besides that i really don't have much of an exciting life.</p></div>
    <div id="soo">
    <p>&emsp;Other than my boring life at home i have at home i have another life which is at morehouse and is pretty fun. Some of the things we do are go to class,play games,talk,and have outside activities and meetings. living in morehouse college is a very fun experience that many kids should think about coming to if you have nothing to do over the summer or just like if you need any help in school or just if you want to learn new topics. But yea that's all about me.</p>
