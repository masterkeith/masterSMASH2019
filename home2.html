<h1 id="key">The Heros Of Health</h1>
<h4 id="hut"> How might we make testing, and dispence of free condoms more accessible to African-American men and women ages 13-27, living in Dekalb County, Georgia? </h4>
<h3 id="hut">The infectious disease that "The Heros Of Health" decided to touch on is HIV/AIDS. This is a disease that is heavily affecting people in our community. Not only are people not using protection when intercourse takes place, but testing for HIV/AIDS is very limited. There are not a lot of places to be tested for this disease, but when it comes to getting tested it takes a pretty long time to get results. That's where our machine comes in to play, "Box O' Aids". "Box O' Aids" is a machine that allows you to test yourself for HIV/AIDS and get instant results back. It makes testing easier to access, and in more secure areas. The machine works by using state of the art technology to analyze your blood and test it for HIV/AIDS. this machine also dispenses condoms when finished with the process. Our target is African-American men and women ages 13-27 in Dekalb County, Georgia. This is because there are a lot of cases where young teens and adults are contracting HIV/AIDS due to lack of protection and safer sex practices. We hope that with our machine we can potentially stop or slow down the spread of HIV/AIDS, and contain this infectious disease as much as possible. </h3>
